Description: The basic idea is to have a keychain with a 1 inch display that stores encrypted NFT keys and displays the images associated with them. 
There would be three components.An embedded system with an LCD display, SD card reader, microcontroller, and battery. This system would display the 
images of the NFT's and store their keys locally. A database which stores the images and web addresses of NFT's. As well as a private key for encryption
and decryption onto the embedded system.A react application for writing and reading to the embedded system's SD card. This would encrypt when writing 
and decrypt when reading. It would also process the NFT's to be suitable for the embedded system's display, and allow for user authentication through 
a private key.
